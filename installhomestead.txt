🧩 1. Install Required Dependencies

    Open your terminal and install VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Git.

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install virtualbox vagrant git unzip -y


    ✅ Note:

    Homestead uses Vagrant to manage virtual machines.

    VirtualBox is the most common provider, but you can use others like Libvirt or VMware if you prefer.


🏠 2. Clone the Homestead Repository

    Clone the official Laravel Homestead repository into your home directory.

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git Homestead


    Go into the Homestead directory:

    cd Homestead


    Checkout the latest stable version:

    git checkout release


⚙️ 3. Run the Initialization Script

This will create the Homestead.yaml configuration file in the ~/.homestead directory.

bash init.sh


🧾 4. Configure Homestead.yaml
    Open the configuration file:

    nano ~/.homestead/Homestead.yaml


    Example configuration:

    ip: "192.168.56.56"
    memory: 2048
    cpus: 2
    provider: virtualbox

    authorize: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    keys:
        - ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    folders:
        - map: ~/code
        to: /home/vagrant/code

    sites:
        - map: homestead.test
        to: /home/vagrant/code/laravel/public

    databases:
        - homestead


    💡 Notes:

    map under folders = your local project folder.

    to = where it will be available inside the VM.

    homestead.test will be your local development domain.

    Ensure you already have an SSH key (if not, run ssh-keygen -t rsa).


🌐 5. Add a Host Entry

    Edit your system’s /etc/hosts file so your browser can resolve the Homestead site.

    sudo nano /etc/hosts


    Add this line:

    192.168.56.56   homestead.test
