That error message —

curl error 28: Failed to connect to repo.packagist.org port 443 after 5200 ms: Connection timed out —
means your computer (or your PHP/Composer process) cannot reach Packagist.org over HTTPS.

Let’s go through common causes and solutions step by step 👇

🧩 1. Check Your Internet / DNS

Try to confirm if your terminal can reach Packagist:

ping repo.packagist.org


or

curl -I https://repo.packagist.org


✅ If it works → move to step 2.
❌ If it fails → your DNS or internet is blocking HTTPS connections to Packagist.

Fix suggestions:

sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
sudo service network-manager restart


or temporarily change DNS to Google or Cloudflare:

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf


Add:

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1


Then try again:

composer update

⚙️ 2. Use an Alternative Mirror (if Packagist is blocked or slow)

If your region or network is slow to connect to repo.packagist.org, try using a mirror like packagist.jp or laravel-china:

composer config -g repos.packagist composer https://packagist.jp


Or:

composer config -g repos.packagist composer https://packagist.org


(to restore the default later)

🔒 3. Check PHP OpenSSL & cURL

Make sure PHP has OpenSSL and cURL enabled:

php -m | grep -E 'curl|openssl'


If not, enable them in your php.ini (usually in /etc/php/8.x/cli/php.ini):

extension=curl
extension=openssl


Then restart PHP-FPM or just try again:

composer update

🕒 4. Increase Composer Timeout

If your connection is just slow, you can increase the default timeout (60s) to something higher:

composer config -g process-timeout 2000


Then run again:

composer update -vvv


(-vvv gives detailed debug output)

🧰 5. Clear Composer Cache

Sometimes stale or corrupted cache causes issues:

composer clear-cache


Then retry:

composer update

🔁 6. Temporary Workaround: Use --prefer-dist or --no-plugins

You can reduce network usage by forcing dist packages:

composer update --prefer-dist


Or skip plugins to isolate the issue:

composer update --no-plugins

✅ 7. If Nothing Works

You can test if the issue is network-level (firewall, proxy, or VPN):

curl https://google.com
curl https://repo.packagist.org


If the first works and the second doesn’t — your ISP or firewall might block the domain.
Try switching to a different network (e.g., mobile hotspot) and retry.
